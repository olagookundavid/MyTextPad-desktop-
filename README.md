# desktop_app

A new Flutter desktop project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point in my desktop journey

It is a simple text app, with a nice and simplistic UI design

#### Functionality
- Write texts
- Save texts in local storage

#### Coming Soon
- View all saved texts
- Edit text files
- Manage files 
- Support other file types like Pdf, Doc etc as it currently has only support for .txt files.
